*Cuetoolkit* is a bunch of tools for reading cuesheet files, splitting images
and filling tracks metadata.

*Cuetoolkit* is free, anybody can use its code in accordance with GNU GPL.v3
and with absolutely NO WARRANTY. For questions, offers and anything else here is
my address: webmaster@auriz.ru.

*Cuetoolkit* was written and tested on Debian and completely compatible with its
stretch or buster branches. However, *cuetoolkit* can be used whit any other
version of Linux.

*Cuetoolkit* requires mutagen and chardet (Python3 modules). In order to use
***cue2tracks*** you have to install the next coders:

* shntool;
* flac;
* monkeys-audio;
* wavpack;
* vorbis-tools;
* opus-tools;
* lame.

Every executable script in *cuetoolkit* requires ***file*** to be installed in
your system.

More information about these tools can be found on my [Internet site](https://codej.ru/3dR8KiCR).
Be aware by the way, the supplementary information is written with Russian
language - my favorite one, and currently not completely ready. :)
